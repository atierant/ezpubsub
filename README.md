ezpubsub
========

eZPubSub is an extension based on PubSubHubBub protocol that makes possible to share content not only between several instances of eZ Publish but also with social networks like Identi.ca and Wordpress.com

PubSubHubBub is a simple, open, server-to-server web-hook-based publish/subscribe protocol and is part of the OStatus standard. It is already used by some decentralized applications like StatusNet or Wordpress to notify events and share content.

This protocol is reallly simple to implement and permits to federate content between different applications in real time.

The idea between eZPubSub is to offer a way to manage content on different instances of eZ Publish which could share content together as soon as it's published.

You won't need to wait for a daily synchronization anymore!
